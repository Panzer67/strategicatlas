        dhfhgfhNuclear Bomb Simulator
Nuclear weapons have made the world a safer place. Until the mid 20th century wars could be fought with the prospect that military victory could be achieved with relatively advantageous gains. Nuclear weapons have changed this perspective to the point that war between nuclear-capable states cannot be won by neither side. The level of destruction that potentially can be inflicted by the involved parties on each other greatly extents that what they can gain from waging war. In other words, nuclear war will most likely result in mutual annihilation. Nuclear weapons in the arsenals of major states therefore have a restraining effect on policy making, especially on issues of war and peace. As correctly noticed by Bernard Brodie at the beginning of the nuclear age: "Thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars. From now on its chief purpose must be to avert them."

Of course no one can guarantee that a major war between nuclear-weapon states is not going to happen in the future. This is because war is still a possibility, therefore direct military engagement between nuclear-weapon states can still occur. One can think of a war over Ukraine between Russia and NATO or a major naval clash between the United States and China over the control of Asia's major sea lanes. But it can be expected that the involved parties will try to limit the fighting and avoid any escalation that leads to total nuclear warfare. The latter would be in no one's interest. That is why the world has been a safer place, although to a certain extend.

Just for the fun of it, I have made a Nuclear Bomb Simulator. I have always been interested in nuclear weapons and since I have developed a passion for programming it became technological possible for me to built a web-based application which could simulate the effects of nuclear blasts. The result is a website that makes use of the ArcGIS javascript api to project the various nuclear effects on satellite images or drawn road maps. I have based the calculations on the technical descriptions which can be found in the 1962 and 1977 editions of the book The Effects of Nuclear Weapons and some Internet sources. Of course, there are on the Internet many more site where you can do the same. I am not suggesting that my site is better or gives a more correct visualization of nuclear bomb effects, but building my own application was just more fun.

Thus, with the Nuclear Bomb Simulator you can choose your favorite nuke and throw it on a city of your choice. The devastation of the detonation are being visualized with the help of circles around a marker. These circles have different radii and colors which mark the different effects. You can click on the marker or check the legend at the bottom of the page for further explanation. If you want to throw multiple bombs just click at another target and another marker with effects circles will appear on the screen. With this ability you can compare the effects of different nuke yields. Furthermore, it is also possible to check the difference between a ground and air burst explosion. Normally an air burst is an explosion at a sufficient height that the fireball does not contact the surface of the earth. For air bursts, my simulator uses optimum burst heights, i.e. the height at which a nukes overpressure can cause the most damage and destruction over the widest area possible. Ground burst explosions produce great overpressure at very close ranges and therefore have a smaller radius of destruction to a given area than an air burst explosion. Surface bursts are very useful to destroy hard targets, such as missile silos. You will find out that after detonation you can drag the marker and radii over other targets or remove them by clicking on them with you right mouse button.
